# C-http-server
An implementation of a simple HTTP server in C.

To build and run the server, do
```
make
make run
```
This will run the server with default settings:
* on port 8000
* serving from `docs` as root directory
* printing errors to console and piping output to `out.log`

The directory `docs` contains several example files and directories. Try reading the server logs after submitting the form at `docs/form.html`.

The project approximately follows Swarthmore's [CS43 Lab 2](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~kwebb/cs43/f17/labs/lab2.html).
