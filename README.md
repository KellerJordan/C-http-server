# C-http-server
A single-file implementation of a simple HTTP server in C, supporting the following features:
* Correct usage of `TCP_CORK` socket option to avoid sending small files in two roundtrips due to [Nagle's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagle%27s_algorithm).
* Acceptance of multiple connections via multithreading (no thread pool, however).
* Serving of directories and `index.html` files when available.
* Fairly high-quality logging.

To build and run the server, just do
```
make run
```
This will run the server with default settings:
* on port 8000
* serving from `docs` as root directory
* printing errors to console and piping output to `out.log`

I am running the server on an AWS `t2.micro` instance running Amazon Linux 2.

The directory `docs` contains several example files and directories. Try reading the server logs after submitting the form at `docs/form.html`.

The project approximately follows Swarthmore's [CS43 Lab 2](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~kwebb/cs43/f17/labs/lab2.html).

If you have the server exposed on the internet, you get to see some odd requests.
